Back in 2008 I was asked by the team at [Ronnie Sunshines](https://www.ronniesunshines.com/) to put together a instructional sequence of images that covers in detail how to set up a tarp and hammock, including all the knots and how to pack the system away neatly.

I have since made the pdf document available for download via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5udwj7e9PdaRmN6Y1p2OWxtUm8/view?usp=sharing)

A lot has changed in the hammock camping scene since then but in a world of hi-tec low weight dyneema and titanium (yeah I love that stuff too ðŸ˜Ž), I think it worth remembering the roots within UK Bushcraft.
