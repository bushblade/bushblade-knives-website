## How I came to be testing an Alpkit tarp

Those who know me know that I'm a massive fan of [Alpkit](https://www.alpkit.com/) gear. When considering the performance you get for the value for money it's hard to beat.

No gear is perfect though and after some long term durability issues I was having with two [Rig 7](https://www.alpkit.com/products/rig-7) tarps, and a few of their [Airlok](https://www.alpkit.com/products/airlok-20l) dry bags, I wrote to them with my findings.
The outcome of those conversations resulted in Alpkit asking me to test out a new prototype for the next generation of Rig 7 tarps.

The main differences between this prototype and the regular Rig 7 tarps is the fabric used. The prototype uses a ripstop polyester fabric instead of the silnylon of the standard Rig 7. This means there is a weight difference of 68g with the prototype weighing in at 604g with stuff sack and the silnylon Rig 7 weighing 536g with stuff sack.
