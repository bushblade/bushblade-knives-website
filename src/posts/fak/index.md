## Why carry a FAK?

If you carry any cutting tool and intend to use it, a good personal first aid kit should accompany it.
Back in 2010 on the bushblade website I had an article about what I carry in my personal first aid kit. It's changed little since then, but here is the kit as of 2016. (2019 update pending)

### Easy to carry

The whole kit is 278g including [alpkit zip pouch](https://www.alpkit.com/products/mission) and easily fits into a trouser cargo pocket which in turn means it is more likely to be available when you actually need it.

### What to carry

The contents of my kit have been tailored to deal with the most common trail side ailments and injuries I have personally experienced. It is intended for the treatment of me personally, though does get used on others if nothing else is available.
I would always recommend putting together your own kit rather than buying a pre-made kit as you can tailor the contents to meet your own specific needs and skill level. The quality of items will be in your control and items will be far easier to obtain when the time comes to restock.

The main item in the kit is a 4" Field dressing with pressure bar, also know as the **Israeli army field dressing** manufactured by [Fenton Pharmaceuticals](http://fentonpharmaceuticals.com/portfolio-items/bandages/)

The rest of the kit is held divided into two _modules_ each housed in a waterproof 4.5" by 7" [Aloksak](https://loksak.com/aloksak/) zip lock bag.
